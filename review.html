                <p>My car has been subjected to boys, mud, walking boots wellies and lots of dogs hair, sounds bad?  it was! 
                    Mathew to the rescue, a fantastic job done! I now have a car to do business in! Sparkling and immaculate. 
                    Thanks Mathew, that was one job I didn't want to tackle, much appreciated

                <p>I had been putting off cleaning my car for ages! And to be honest it was a mess! I spoke to Mathew at 
                Cardiff yesterday and he came over this morning!! He spent a couple of hours on it and did a cracking job, 
                the car looks better now than when I bought it!
